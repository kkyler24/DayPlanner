<!-- 1. Step 1: creating a basic calendar frame. 
    1. Create the rows and columns
        a. What do we need in these rows and columns 
            1. Columns should have the days of the weeks
            2. each cell should be a number from 1-30/31 depending on the month in question. 
            3. The Top Column should display the current month.  -->
Break down
<!-- to dolist -->
2. Step 2: Create a to do list
    a. what do we need to get this done
    b. create rows
    c. items that are done need to be striked out or disappear
        1. delete button, how to we get this to delete?
           a. onclick event lister?
           b. consider oneclick = turn item green for in progress, and double click = turn item to strikout for done, user can then have option to delete done items, with trash cna button X.
    d. How do we add items to the list?
        1. What type of list? 
            a. organized list with indents and space for notes
            b.Do we want reminders?  
    c. each row, need to compare current time to row association 
        1. the input should chnage depending on time
            a. red =current time
            b. grey= past
            c. green = future
        2. each row has a save button
            a. needs to grab value of input tag
            b. Being able to save to local storage
                1. when page loads need sto retrieve info to fill page 
                2. then save to local storage. 
                3. give middle row input ids
                4. usee jquery to grab current time and compare to time to see if equal, past or present.
